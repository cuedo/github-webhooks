## Features
* Best-in-class JSON decoding via [aeson].
* Unicode string support via [text].
* Suitable for large data payloads using [vector].
* Type-safe encoding of optional data.
* Type-safe event action encodings with support for future API changes.
* Instances for Typeable, Data, Generic and NFData.
* Strongly typed utility classes EventHasSender, EventHasRepo et al.
* Strict data types suitable for high performance streaming operations.
* Full support for [these event types](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#event-types--payloads).

## Installation
`github-webhooks` is available via installation on [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/github-webhooks) and [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/package/github-webhooks).

## Examples
Minimal working example:
```hs
$ stack ghci bytestring aeson github-webhooks
import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as BSL
import           Data.Aeson           ( eitherDecode' )

json <- BSL.readFile "fixtures/watch-event.json"
eitherDecode' json :: Either String WatchEvent
```

Some practical integration examples are also provided:
* [Servant Integration (Simple)](./examples/servant-simple#readme)  
  Minimal working example of integrating this package with [servant] and [servant-github-webhook].
* [Servant Integration (Typical)](./examples/servant#readme)  
  This example demonstrates more advanced use-cases with [servant] by decoding multiple different types of payloads on the same endpoint.
* [Scotty Integration](./examples/scotty#readme)  
  Minimal working example of integrating this package with [scotty].
